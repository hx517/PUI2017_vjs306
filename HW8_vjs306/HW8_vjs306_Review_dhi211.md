### CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

- I found this easy to decipher what was trying to be conveyed - warmer colors correspond to higher fatalities in the area; cooler colors to fewer fatalities in the area. 
- Locations where the most events occurred correspond to the description of the image as well.

[Recommendation] 
- Values are needed on the label to understand the magnitude of fatalities for each icon. I would like to know the magnitude of each icon on the map is and how many fatalities it corresponds to. 
- Clarifying the time during which this data was recorded would be helpful to understand all that this plot conveys. This could be addressed in the title or legend (i.e. "Cyclist Fatalities in 2015").

### ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?
- Colors are nice and simple - this is good.
- Itâ€™s good that the geography of NYC can clearly be seen.

[Recommendation] 
- Plotting major bicycle routes or other geographic assets on top of the heat maps could also provide more definition to where these incidents are occurring. Future study could investigate other geographic features where fatalities occur, for example, where highways meet local roads, or busy intersections, to name two examples.

### HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
- The data is honestly displaying the available data. It is helpful to see in which parts of the city cycling fatalities are appearing. 

[Recommendation] 
- The heatmap-type display might give the impression that multiple fatalities occured at a given point, when potentially only one fataility occured. Rethinking how the map would account for this could help clarify outliers to the data.
